 POLITICS_ECKHART_THEISMANN_DESC:0 "A veteran of the Roman Balkan War, Eckhart Theismann is a popular candidate among the Germanic people. Originally running as an independant in the 1924 elections, he later joined the Conservative Party and won first in 1928 and then in 1932. His term has has seen the Germanic economy and the standard of living soar across the board, so many believe that he is almost certain to win the next election as well."
 POLITICS_ROMAN_SENATE_DESC:0 "The Roman Senate is the longest surviving politcal institution in the world. Created during the first day of the City of Rome and the Roman Kingdom, it survived the overthrow of the kings and transformed from an advisory council to the primary political institution of the Roman Republic. Though it's powers were stripped away after the end of the Republican Era, and with the beginning of the Roman Dark Age it remained little more than a rubberstamp for more than the next millenia, the Revival of the Republic in 1864, as a disgruntled public ousted the Emperor in favour of the elected Senators, reinstated the Senate as the supreme power in Rome."
 POLITICS_CASSIUS_VALERIANUS_DESC:0 "Born in Sicilia in 1898, Valerianus eventually enrolled in the University of Rome. There he made contacts with members of anti-senate and pro-liberal democracy movements, and eventually he joined himself. He was one of the founding members and soon Chairman of the 'Roman People's Voice', party opposed to the current system of Roman democracy, inspired by liberal republics such as Germania or Gallia. As it started gaining traction, the Senate caught wind and outlawed it, with many members arrested or forced into exile, the latter of which applied to Valerianus. From across the border in the European Coalition, he has published many articles advocating for a major reform in the Roman Republic."
 POLITICS_QINTUS_DESC:0 "Quintus is the head of the Marcallas family, are a prominant family granted patrician status by Imperator Canus Marcius Archarius at the beginning of the Second Golden Age, becoming one of the most powerful families besides the Emperor's. The family lost much of it's power and prestige during the Restoration of the Republic. Quintus's dislike for the Republic and the senate is no secret, though he has never stated it explicitly. But with many imperial restorationists naming him as their choice for emperor should they succeed, Quintus didn't have to do much more than be patient and wait for the right moment to strike..."
 POLITICS_BENITO_MUSSOLINI_DESC:0 "Mussolinius was born in small village near Forum Livii to a school teacher and a blacksmith. He quickly took on his father's socialist ideology, with a tinge of nationalism. As he entered adulthood, he became an editor for various socialist newspaper, and ran into trouble with the law numerous times for agitation and anti-government sentiment. In 1905 he volunteered to fight in the Balkan War, an experience which radically altered his political views. Once he returned home, he was a zealous Roman nationalist and believed that without the betrayal by the senate, Rome could have won. His unorthodox beliefs have brought him in conflict with other members of the party, but has proven suprisingly popular with some sections of the populus."
 POLITICS_PIETRO_DESC:0 "Born to a peasant family, Pietrus was orphaned at a young age, and was placed into an orphanage by an aristocratic family. As an adult he joined the Socialist Party. He became an editor of a newspaper in Forum Livii, where he met Mussolinius, and the two became friends. Both supported the Balkan War when it started in 1905, and Pietrus volunteered. Unlike Mussolinius, after the war Pietrus became staunchly anti-nationalist, thus coming into conflict and becoming rivals with his former friend. He became the chairman of the Socialist Party in 1931, and was forced into exile to Gallia when the government attempted to arrest him along with many other party members."
 POLITICS_SEX_DESC:0 "Sextus Atrius Betto's father had been a prominant senator, and thus Sextus was already well-connected when he entered politics at the age of 26. Since childhood praised for being well-tempered and of good judgement, he proved to be a competent politician and quickly manouvered up the ranks, becoming a Quaestor in 1924, Aedile in 1930, Praetor in 1933 and then eventually even being chosen as one of the Consuls. His prominant position and calm desposition meant that when the state of emergency was declared and a dictator had to be elected, the senate eventually found him to be the natural choice."
 POLITICS_TOKUGAWA_IESATO_DESC:0 "After the death of his adoptive father, Tokugawa Yoshinobu, in 1913, Iesato became the head of the Tokugawa Clan, and the Shogun of Japan."
 POLITICS_PIOTR_MODRZEWSKI_DESC:0 "Considered one of the most influencial politicians in Venedia in the past century, Modrzewski is famed for his role in keeping the young republic together during the first years of it's formation. Having brought what seems to be lasting stability to the nation, as long as he lives the republic is sure to survive. There are rumours, however, that his health is failing..."
 POLITICS_ALEKSANDR_SITEK_DESC:0 "Born in Krakow to a working-class family, as he was growing up Sitek experienced the effects of poverty and harsh conditions first hand. As a youth he worked in a shoe factory, which is where he first encountered the idea of industrial unionism - and the violent crackdowns against it. From there he was drawn into more and more radical politics, eventually leading to him becoming the leader of the Venedic Industrial Union Congress."
 POLITICS_KONDRAT_SURMA_DESC:0 "For as long as he held political beliefs, Surma was a Venedic nationalist through-and-through. During his time in university, he joined a group of ardent Venedic nationalists known as the Knights of Venedia. With First Venedic Republic collapsing into an absolute mess, to Surma the next two decades of chaos were an embarassment to the proud nation of Venedia, and he knew the blame lay with the inept politicians and monarchs. After the Knights of Venedia was disbanded when a fail assassination led to the arrest to most of it's members, Surma founded his own organisation, calling itself the Iron League."
