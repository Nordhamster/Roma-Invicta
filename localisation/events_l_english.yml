 rome.1.d:0 "After our government's stability reached catastrophic levels, the democratic movement within our country declared our government illegitimate and has risen up in armed conflict against us! Despite our sources implying that they have supporters all over the country, the insurgents have only been able to consolidate their power in the region of Roman Gallia, and a number of divisions have defected to their side. It looks like we have a civil war on our hands..."

 news.1.t:0 "Roman Civil War"
 news.1.d:0 "In response to the collapse in political stability in [RME.GetNameDef], the democratic movements have risen up in armed conflict and declared the old government illegitimate. The rebels have Southern Gallia firmly under their control, and they claim to have supporters all over the country. The rebellion is currently small, but the situation could easily develop into a serious problem for [RME.GetNameDef]. Already, armies and militias are moving to meet each-other at the borders - The Roman Civil War has begun..."

 news.2.t:0 "[QNG.GetName] Refuses Japanese Demands"
 news.2.d:0 "Earlier today, [QNG.GetNameDef] sent a reply in response to [JAP.GetNameDef]'s ultimatum, refusing to accept Japanese demands for concessions. The demands were made in response to supposed Chinese agression on the border, and would involve the removal of Chinese troops from the Japanese border in Korea, as well as the annexation of the port of Qingdao by Japan. Chinese Ambassadors have called these demands 'completely unjustified', 'outrageous' and 'a violation of Chinese sovreignity'. The already high tensions between the two nations have become even more strained because of this, and it seems the breaking point is close."
 news.2.a:0 "Wrong choice..."
 news.2.b:0 "We won't give in!"
 news.3.t:0 "[QNG.GetName] Buckles to Japanese Demands"
 news.3.d:0 "Earlier today, [QNG.GetNameDef] agreed to comply to the terms of the [JAP.GetNameDef]'s ultimatum. Already, Chinese forces are moving out of the newly created demilitarised zone around the Korean border, and the annexation of the port city of Qingdao by the Japanese is being finalised. The Japanese have expressed great satisfaction to this, saying that they 'look forward to future co-operation between our two nations.'"
 news.3.a:0 "A pleasant development."
 news.3.b:0 "We had no choice..."
 news.100.c:0 "This is a disaster!"
 news.101.t:0 "The Fall of Rome"
 news.101.d:0 "For the first time since 410, Rome has once again fallen to barbarians. Germanic forces recently entered Rome following a fierce battle through the streets with the defending garrison, and the Germanic tricolour now flies above the Eternal City. The city's many historical landmarks mostly remain intact, save for the occasional bullet-hole. [RME.GetLeader] and the magistrates of the Roman Senate were nowhere to be found, presumably having fled during the attack.\n\nThe fall of it's capital is a terrible blow to the [RME.GetNameDef], both strategically and in terms of morale. Is it possible that after nearly three millenia, Rome had finally reached it's end?"
 news.101.b:0 "Roma Victa"
 news.102.d:0 "Earlier today, following a prolonged battle through the streets of Rome, enemy forces were able to rout the Roman defenders, and are now in control of the capital of [RME.GetNameDef]. There are some reports that there has been looting of historical sites, however these reports have been denied. [RME.GetLeader], along with the rest of the government, were successfully evacuated prior to the attack.\n\nThe fall of it's capital is a terrible blow to the [RME.GetNameDef], both strategically and in terms of morale. Is it possible that after nearly three millenia, Rome had finally reached it's end?"
 news.145.a:0 "A significant development."
 
 china.1.t:0 "Japanese Political Pressure"
 china.1.d:0 "The [JAP.GetName] has been increasingly hostile in it's diplomatic relations with us, citing obviously fabricated violations of their borders and sovreignity. This finally culminated with the ultimatum presented to us earlier today, listing the Japanese demands; the port city of Qingdao will be annexed by Japan and the area around Korea will become demilitarised, with our troop prohibited from entering.\n\nThese demands are obviously ridiculous and completely unjustified, however it is likely that refusing may be used as justification to further hostilities."
 china.1.a:0 "Outrageous!"
 china.1.b:0 "We can't afford a conflict with Japan"
 
 japan.1.t:0 "China Refuses!"
 japan.1.d:0 "[QNG.GetNameDef] has refused to accept our ultimatum! [QNG.GetLeader] claims that our resonable demands are 'unjustified' and 'outrageous'. This is the perfect justification for more aggressive measures to be taken, although it maybe prudent to wait for the perfect moment to strike..."
 japan.1.a:0 "We'll have to teach them some manners!"
 japan.2.t:0 "China Accepts Ultimatum"
 japan.2.d:0 "[QNG.GetNameDef] has wisely decided to accept the reasonable demands of our ultimatum. Qingdao is now under our control and the area around the Korean border is now free of Chinese troops."
 japan.2.a:0 "A wise decision..."
