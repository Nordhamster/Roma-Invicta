The demands were made in response to supposed Chinese agression on the border, and would involve the removal of Chinese troops from the Japanese border in Korea, as well as the annexation of the port of Qingdao by Japan. Chinese Ambassadors have called these demands 'completely unjustified', 'outrageous' and 'a violation of Chinese sovreignity'.

 stability.21.t:0 "Draft Dodging"
 stability.21.desc.a:0 "A new report by the War Office shows a marked reduction in available manpower. It appears that the latest batch of recruits is much smaller than initially expected. The discrepacy is currently under investigation, but first leads point towards a large number of people who are technically fit for service managing to avoid the draft through various means. 18 year old students are suddenly skilled workers employed in critical war industry, former athletes fail their fitness tests and in some cases, recruits have simply vanished without a trace.\n\nWhen people are caught and interrogated, they point towards the poor conditions in the army, the indifferent officers and not wanting to die for a lost cause. Military leaders demand a harsh crackdown on people avoiding the draft, but many in the government believe that improving the living conditions of enlisted soldiers might be the better approach."
 stability.21.desc.b:0 "The ineffective official response to the widespread avoidance of the draft has only made the problem worse. More and more recruits never show up after receiving their drafting letter. Counter-Intelligence has intercepted a professionally made pamphlet advising people on how to avoid the draft, suggesting things like bribing doctors to certify the recruit to be medically unfit. Exceptions for family fathers have led to war widows with children finding themselves mobbed with marriage proposals while the number of people applying for exceptions for ethical reasons have hit record numbers.\n\nMilitary leaders have suggested eliminating the last few exceptions and make examples out of a few shirkers that have been caught. Others in the government have suggested that we should appeal to the sense of civic duty in our citizens and point out the consequences of a defeat in this war."
 stability.21.desc.c:0 "With government responses to draft dodging having no positive effects whatsoever, more and more people have started to wonder why they should put themselves at risk while others stay in safety. Recruits that do turn up often report being harrassed or ridiculed in the streets as fools fighting for a doomed cause. Reports of mothers forbidding their children from answering the draft order are everywhere, and the War Office has submitted a report claiming that they are no longer sure how many people they are supposed to draft, as their bureaucracy has started to break down under the strain of processing all those missing soldiers."

 stability.22.desc.a:0 "Production in several factories has slowed down dramatically over the last few days as the workers have declared a strike on all war production. Demanding "Peace and Bread!", they have so far refused all attempts to negotiate a settlement. Some in the government have advocated a sharp military response, followed by a swift execution of the ringleaders as enemy agents and traitors. However, others in the civil service have recommended a more measured approach, pointing out that a heavy-handed response may well backfire if the soldiers involved are not as loyal as we thought they were."
 stability.22.desc.b:0 "Government efforts to convince the strikers to return to work seem to have had no effect whatsoever. On the contrary, strikes have been reported in further factories, and the last few hold outs in the originally affected work sites have also put down their tools after facing the anger of their colleagues. While stockpiles have so far been able to cushion the blow to front line supplies somewhat, it is only a question of time before the production outages start to affect our ability to prosecute the war.\n\nThe War Office has again urged the government to take an unyielding line with the strikers, but other factions inside the administration have suggested that offering to meet the workers half-way may be enough to convince them to return to work."
 stability.22.desc.c:0 "What started as industrial action in a few isolated places has now spread across the entire country, affecting even industries that are only connected to the war effort in tertiary ways. Even the workings of the government itself have become affected, as many low level clerks, messengers, and drivers have refused to show up to work in increasing numbers. \n\nIn many places, worker councils have taken over the factory buildings. Reports from the secret police indicate that some places seem to have started production of weapons again - for a major uprising against what is being called "The War Regime".\n\nMilitary High Command believes that decisive action by loyal troops could still win the day, while the civilian side of the government argues that this risks a civil war and certain defeat."

While none of the units have left their position in the line, representatives of the soldiers have made it quite clear that they will not obey any orders to attack the enemy.\n\nThe rebellion has so far been contained to a small number of battalions and a handful of training and support units, but many in the War Office fear that this uprising will soon spread to other units and may eventually render us unable to continue the war. Decisive action is needed."
 stability.23.desc.b:0 "Efforts to address the mutinies in the army have shown no effect. Emboldened by the lack of effective government response, the muntineers have expanded their list of demands to include an immediate cease-fire followed by a comprehensive peace treaty and demobilization.\n\nThe War Office strongly recommends that we send a strong signal to the mutineers to deter any further action on their part."

In several cases, street battles erupted between the police and the protesters, leading to a number of fatalities when the soldiers were forced to use their weapons to defend themselves. It took several hours until the police gained full control over the situation.\n\nAn ugly mood has settled over the capital as the barricades are cleared away and the dead are buried. Reports from the War Office show no change in the number of recruits reporting for duty. Many in the government wonder how much longer we can continue fighting under these circumstances."

Higher pay and more frequent leave are often cited as the biggest new benefits, but many also point to the new government programs to support war widows and orphans. Fewer and fewer men can justify refusing their country's call to the colors, and public support for draft-dodgers has all but disappeared.\n\nIndeed, there has been a recent upswing in public support for the government as more and more people realize that the [Root.GetAdjective] way of life is under attack."

At dawn, military police raided the homes of a number of carefully selected, well known and connected people who have used their influence to allow others to avoid the draft. Still in their nightgowns, they have found themselves conscripted into the military and escorted to the barracks under armed guard, where they will be formed up into a separate unit, to avoid their subversive influence from spreading to other units. \n\nThe news of this has spread quickly, and it appears that most people who until now believed that they could get away with ignoring their draft notice have changed their mind. Recruitment stations across the country report that a growing number of people have come by to ask what exactly the consequences would be if a "friend" of theirs who had attempted to avoid the draft would turn themselves in."

Still in their nightgowns, they have found themselves conscripted into the military. Their families have mobilized their extensive support networks to protest this descision. The War Office has been flooded with calls and letters from simple workers who want their factory manager back to undersecretaries in various other ministeries, demanding to know why people working in fields critical to the war effort have been removed from their work.

Claiming to be from a soldier who at first tried to avoid the draft, but then realized that he must fight to save his country, it has apparently struck a nerve with many others who felt similarly.

Given the grave situation we are in, the War Office has decided that these men be tried under military law for failing to report to duty.

Rather than bringing people back to the colors out of fear of the consequences, it has made those executed into instant martyrs for the peace movement. Their names and life stories have been published and very clearly edited to make them appear in the best possible light. Mass peace demonstrations have started in several major cities, demanding an end to the war.

As the troops moved in, they found the workers alert and ready for them. The first assault broke down in hails of thrown stones. A second assault with fixed bayonets was repulsed in brutal hand-to-hand fighting, leaving dozens of dead and dying in the streets.\n\nThe officers in charge have pulled back to consolidate their forces, while the workers are extending their fortifications and arming themselves with the weapons left behind in the retreat. A second day of fighting is expected tommorrow, but Military High Command does no longer believe that victory is likely."
 strikes_event.8.a:0 "We are quickly running out of options."
 strikes_event.9.t:0 "The Worker's Rights Protection Act"
 strikes_event.9.desc:0 "With tensions running high across the capital, [Root.GetLeader] announced a new law to protect the rights of workers even in times of war. The sweeping legislation mandates paid sick leave without limits, mandatory accident insurance for every worker, the right to join any union as well as, for the first time, the right for any employed women to have maternity leave after the birth of a child.\n\nWhile many in the government consider this nothing less than a complete surrender to the strikers, the results are conclusive: work has resumed in all factories."
 strikes_event.9.a:0 "Hopefully this will be enough."
 mutiny_event.1.t:0 "Mutiny Crushed"
 mutiny_event.1.desc:0 "After a few hours of tense negotiations at barracks gates and in front line dugouts, the mutiny in our army is over. Faced with the prospect of a fight they could not win, the mutineers quickly decided to stand down. \n\nThe primary issue then became the fate of those that had refused orders. Military High Command has opted for clemency and assured the mutineers that they would not be punished harshly. A few examples have been made in which some soldiers were demoted to a lower rank and transferred to a different unit."
 mutiny_event.1.a:0 "Let's hope that is the last of it."
 mutiny_event.2.t:0 "An empty threat"
 mutiny_event.2.desc:0 "Attempts to scare the mutineers into submission have backfired spectacularly as the troops showed little fear of the units sent to supress them. Using skills honed on the front lines, they quickly organized a defense of their positions that would make any attempt to defeat them very costly. \n\nThe officers in charge of the loyalist units have pulled back and are awaiting further orders, but this small success has no doubt strengthened the mutineers' resolve."
 mutiny_event.2.a:0 "No one could have predicted this."
 mutiny_event.3.t:0 ""What ARE we fighting for?""
 mutiny_event.3.desc:0 ""It's not uncommon for a soldier to doubt whether what he is doing is really worth it. Can anything justify the sacrifices we ask of you? Can we really demand you to potentially die in pursuit of a goal that you would never see?\n\nIt is an unfortunate fact that we must live in the times we were born in. Fate has decided that we must be at war, to protect our freedom, our homes, our [Root.GetAdjective] way of life! We did not choose this war, it was forced on us! You know that I would not ask anything of you that I would not be willing to do myself, and I know that you will do whatever is necessary to secure victory."\n\n[Root.GetLeader]'s speech in front of the troops appears to have had the desired effect, as the soldiers broke out in spontaneous cheers and returned to their duties without more than the usual amount of complaining."
 mutiny_event.3.a:0 "Good speech."
 mutiny_event.4.t:0 "The Treason In War Act"
 mutiny_event.4.desc:0 "While the War Office is doing its best to keep the current mutiny in the army from becoming widely known, censoring letters can only go so far. Soldiers on leave quickly spread the word that the army is no longer willing to bleed needlessly in this war.\n\nWithout mentioning the mutiny specifically, [Root.GetLeader] announced today that the government would now consider any act that reflected a lack of commitment to the war to be treason.\n\nThe punishment for treason is well known, and public support for the mutineers has all but evaporated. News of this was, of course, widely spread. Seeing little support from the general population, the soldiers have quietly resumed their duties."

Reports from the Secret Police indicate that the mutineers have a strong backing in the general public, making it unlikely that we can isolate and surpress them."

 mutiny_event.6.desc:0 "[Root.GetLeader] announced to the press today that his latest peace offer has failed. While the causes for this unfortunate turn of events are very complex, the [Root.GetAdjective] demand that the other side pay for all damages caused, disarm completely and publically acknowledge that they started the war may have been the final straw.\n\nOur enemies have responded in kind, calling our reasonable requests a demand for unconditional surrender. They have promised that they will prosecute this war until the bitter end. \n\nWith our enemies evidently unwilling to see reason and promising to fight on, attempts by the mutineers to force a peace settlement have collapsed."
 mutiny_event.6.a:0 "Terrible shame."
 mutiny_event.7.t:0 "Military Crackdown succeeds."
 mutiny_event.7.desc:0 "Despite a few instances in which small groups of mutineers decided to make a fight out of it, our operation to crush the rebellion has been a stunning success. Relying on numbers rather than skill, loyalist militias surrounded the muntineers' strongholds and demanded their surrender. Most soldiers decided not to take up arms against their own countrymen and surrendered peacefully. \n\nThe ringleaders will be tried in secret court martials, but the average soldier will be sent back to the front, albeit in a different unit to prevent mutineers from forming new cells."
 mutiny_event.7.a:0 "Well done."
 mutiny_event.8.t:0 "Brother against Brother"
 mutiny_event.8.desc:0 "Our attempts to prevent the elections for the Worker and Soldier Councils have escalated the situation beyond even the most pessimistic estimation. Rather than surrendering, the mutineers have formed provisional Councils, elected field commanders and set up defenses in the streets. It is clear that they aim to make a fight out of this.\n\nThe rifts in the army now run through every unit and often even between members of the same family. [Root.GetNameDefCap] stands poised at the edge of a civil war."
 mutiny_event.8.a:0 "This keeps getting worse."
 mutiny_event.9.t:0 "A new breed of officer"
 mutiny_event.9.desc:0 "Despite strong objections from the military, every unit in the [Root.GetAdjective] Army carried out elections to select their commander. The results have been very surprising, as most of the elected are accomplished soldiers with plenty of experience in the field. While many professional officers still consider this to be a personal insult, there can be little doubt that most soldiers dramatically prefer this situation."
