 rome.1.t:0 "Democratic Uprising!"
 rome.1.d:0 "After our government's stability dropped to catastrophic levels, the democratic movement within our country declared our government illegitimate and has risen up in armed conflict against us! Despite our sources implying that they have supporters all over the country, the insurgents have only been able to consolidate their power in the region of Roman Gallia, and a number of divisions have defected to their side. It looks like we have a civil war on our hands..."
 rome.1.a:0 "Traitors!"
 rome.1.b:0 "You know, they make some good points..."
 
 rme_senate.1.t:0 "Elections to Congress"
 rme_senate.1.desc:0 "Every two years, a third of the Senate seats and all seats in the House of Representatives are up for election. While often overshadowed by world events, the local situation in each constituency can sometimes make the difference. \n\nAfter all the votes were counted, the faction in support of the government [RME.GetSenateElectionOutcome] in the Senate and [RME.GetHouseElectionOutcome] in the House."
 rme_senate.1.a:0 "The people have spoken."
 SenateElectionLost:0 "lost [?sen_loc] seats"
 SenateElectionGained:0 "gained [?sen_loc] seats"
 HouseElectionLost:0 "lost [?ror_loc] seats"
 HouseElectionGained:0 "gained [?ror_loc] seats"
 rme_senate.2.t:0 "A Shift in the Political Landscape"
 rme_senate.2.desc:0 "With a new president now in office, the former opposition in Congress has largely shifted to support the new administration. President [USA.GetLeader] can count on the support of [?plebs_support] Senators and [?senators_support] Representatives."
 rme_senate.2.a:0 "The people have spoken."
 rme_senate_congress_elections_tt_bad:0 "In the congressional elections, the faction supporting the government will face stronger opposition.\n"
 rme_senate_congress_elections_tt_good:0 "The momentum gained from the presidential election is likely to carry over to the congressional elections.\n"
 rme_senate.3.t:0 "Government Faction wins Majority in Congress"
 rme_senate.3.desc:0 "It appears that the reforms of the electoral system we instituted have been most successful, as a large number of our supporters were elected to Congress in the last election. With a solid majority, we should have little trouble pushing through our political agenda."
 rme_senate.3.a:0 "A clear sign of our support in the population."
 rme_senate.5.t:0 "Senator votes for Government Proposal"
 rme_senate.5.desc:0 "In a recent vote, a senator has suprisingly switched sides to vote for a government proposal. While the issue itself was fairly minor, the public vote of support from a previously outspoken critic of [USA.GetLeader] has raised many eyebrows around Washington.\n\nSome analysts believe that this example will lead additional senators to reconsider their stance."
 rme_senate.5.a:0 "A useful ally."
 rme_senate.6.t:0 "Senator speaks passionately in support of Government"
 rme_senate.6.desc:0 "Asked about his stance on a number of policy issues at a fund-raising dinner, a representative spoke out in support of the Consuls' policies. He further claimed that many of his fellow senators had similar views, but were merely held back by "idiotic short-sightedness, thinking no further than the next election" instead of doing what was right for the Roman people. \n\nHis comments have been widely reported by the press and put several of his colleagues in hot water as they had to explain where they stood on these issues."
 rme_senate.6.a:0 "He is right, you know."
 rme_senate.7.t:0 "Senator speaks out against Government Policy"
 rme_senate.7.desc:0 "A Senator has given an interview in a major newspaper, saying that he can no longer support the "foolish and dangerous" policies of President [USA.GetLeader]. He further claimed that he knew several other Senators who thought similarly and would abandon the President in short order."
 rme_senate.7.a:0 "He'll come running back soon enough."
 rme_senate.8.t:0 "Representative criticizes President"
 rme_senate.8.desc:0 "During a recent debatte on tax reform, a Representative launched into a long-winded speech about the many failings of the Administration. According to him, no right-thinking American could possibly want to support the policies of the President, whatever their party affiliation may be. \n\nHis harsh words seem to have had an effect, as a number of Representatives previously thought firmly behind the policies of [USA.GetLeader] made noises of support."
 rme_senate.8.a:0 "Disgraceful."
 rme_senate.9.t:0 "Opposition suffers defeat in the Senate"
 rme_senate.9.desc:0 "A motion to censure President [USA.GetLeader] has been defeated in the Senate. While even its most ardent supporters had little hope that it would pass, the amount of votes against it came as a shock even to the most pessimistic of observers. It appears that the President enjoys a far greater level of support in the Senate than most believed, which should help in advancing his legislative agenda."
 rme_senate.9.a:0 "Great."
 rme_senate.10.t:0 "Passionate Speaker at Plebian Assembly"
 rme_senate.10.desc:0 "During the ratification of a decision by the senate"
 rme_senate.10.a:0 "As well they should."
 rme_senate.11.t:0 "Senator retires"
 rme_senate.11.desc:0 "Following a minor heart attack, a senior Senator announced today that he will be retiring for health reasons. With more than two decades in Congress, the Senator built a large network of supporters and his influence carried a lot of weight. While technically only one man with one vote, Washington insiders nonetheless counted him as worth several votes as he was the key to secure several others. \n\nWith the seat most likely going to an avowed critic of President [USA.GetLeader], the Administration will find it a lot harder to secure the necessary votes to pass bills."
 rme_senate.11.a:0 "He will be missed. And his vote as well."
 rme_senate.12.t:0 "House hearings into Presidential misconduct"
 rme_senate.12.desc:0 "A minor scandal originating in the White House has started to gain momentum. Following weeks of media reports implying that a minor administrative official had been taking bribes in return for lucrative government contracts, the House Committe on Expenditures in the Executive has begun to hold hearings to determine if the President was aware of this. While most observers don't believe that this will lead to any major trouble for President [USA.GetLeader], it will no doubt mean that many of the president's supporters will have to lay low for a while."
 rme_senate.12.a:0 "A witchhunt."
 rme_senate.15.t: "The Nationrat calls for snap elections!"
 rme_senate.15.d: "2 days ago, [From.GetLeader] asked the vote of confidence in the National Council. He lost this accordingly, now have to call new elections." 
 rme_senate.15.a: "There's No way around it. The People will vote in 50 Days."
 rme_senate.15.b: "There's No way around it. The People will vote in 100 Days."
 rme_senate.15.c: "There's No way around it. The People will vote in 150 Days."
 rme_senate.16.t: "The Snap Elections"
 rme_senate.16.d: "Today are the Snap Elections, who will win?"
 rme_senate.16.a: "The Democratic Faction."
 rme_senate.16.b: "The Neutral Faction"
 rme.senate.16.c: "The Communist Faction"
 rme_senate.16.d: "The Fascists! Down with Democracy!"
