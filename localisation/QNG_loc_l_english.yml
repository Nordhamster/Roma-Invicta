 china.1.d:0 "The [JAP.GetName] has been increasingly hostile in it's diplomatic relations with us, citing obviously fabricated violations of their borders and sovreignity. This finally culminated with the ultimatum presented to us earlier today, listing the Japanese demands; the port city of Qingdao will be annexed by Japan and the area around Korea will become demilitarised, with our troop prohibited from entering.\n\nThese demands are obviously ridiculous and completely unjustified, however it is likely that refusing may be used as justification to further hostilities."
