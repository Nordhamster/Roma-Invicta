 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "The End of an Era"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The world is about to change. In Europe, Rome is beginning to once again lose it's grip on power. It's economy and government stagnating, it would take radical changes to rescue the nation from it's downward spiral. In Asia, the Qing dynasty's repulsion to reform and progress has sown seeds of dissent within. With Japan quickly expanding their empire, how long can the Emperor hope to keep his grasp on the Empire? As the fall of great empires imminent, jealous eyes begin to watch, waiting for their chance to claim a peice of their own..."

 GAL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Despite the devastation of the Great War, France has been on the road to recovery thanks to a strong economy. However, the Depression has still affected the country and the new German regime has no interest in paying the war reparations stipulated by the Treaty of Versailles.\n\nWhen the treaty was signed, a French marshal famously remarked that it was not peace, but an armistice of 20 years. Those 20 years are now rapidly running out."
 GER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "What was once a scattering of small duchies and kingdoms, the Confederation joined into a single, united nation. By the start of the 19th century, the Confederation became a republic, leading the way to the democratisation of North-Western Europe. Leading the European Coalition, the Confederation plays a major role in European politics. \nThe imminent fall of the Roman Republic means the Confederation has a great chance to end rivalry between Germanic representative democracy and Roman senate democracy, and to prove to the world that it is the people, not elites, who should rule."
 RME_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "For over almost three millenia, whether Kingdom, Republic or Empire, Rome has withstood the test of time. With the Roman Dark Age ending in the 1500's, the Romans entered a Second Golden Age, once again taking their place as the centre of civilisation, culture and trade in Europe. But, nothing lasts forever - Rome is again crumbling. Economic stagnation, corruption, social discontent. Half a century ago, the Roman populus, angered by the incompotent emperors, re-established the Republic of yore. However, the humiliating defeat in the Balkan War has destroyed the faith of many in the new government. How can Rome hope to survive..?"
 JAP_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Unlike its neighbours, the Shogunate of Japan fully embraced westernisation. Now with a burgeoning industry and formidable military, Japan stands as one of the leading nations in Asia, it's influence stretching across the pacific. \n\nHowever, Japan's industries are starving for resources. Two targets remain - the small nations of Indochina and the Pacific would be easy prey, but a rapidly destablising China and it's American colonies could prove to be a much more bountiful prize..."
 QNG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "At the centre of the world rests the Celestial Empire, ruled by the fair and just Qing Emperor. The further one strays from the the bastion of civilisation that is China, the more barbaric the civilisations are found. So it has been believed for millenia. \nYet as the world began to change rapidly around them, the Emperors refused to accept social reform and technological progress, and now China lacks both. Meanwhile in the east, a rapidly industrialising Japan is beginning to look like a problem, as it spreads it's empire throughout Asia and the Pacific. What future awaits the Middle Kingdom...?"
 YAK_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Originating from the nation known the Tungus Khanate, an agrarian, feudalistic state, in 1914 a collectivist revolution lead by Comrade Ayarkhaan transformed it into the United Workers's Republics of Yakutia-Evenkia and set the nation on the path of modernisation and industrialisation. \n\nFor a nation so far behind the world technologically and industrially, the path will not be easy, and some sacrifices will need to be made, but if Yakutia-Evenkia is to survive in a world turned against it, there must be progress - by whatever means necessary."
 RAM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "With the discovery of the Americas, the Empires of Europe scrambled to gain a foot-hold in the New World, and reap it's bountiful resources. Much Roman blood was spilled to conquer and hold their precious colonies. \nHowever, Roman power is now fading, and as the Roman grip on the New World begins to weaken, independence movements are beginning to appear. People now see themselves as Americans rather than Romans. As Rome begins to crumble, it may be time for America to forge it's own destiny..."
 OTHER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The nations of the europe will not content to sit back and watch Roman lands be taken by their rivals. If Rome is destined to fall, then each will want to take their piece. Meanwhile in Asia, there is a hope that maybe China will face the same fate..."
 CTL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "At the turn of the century the some of the largest trading guilds in China, outraged at the Qing Emperors' refusal to expand trade, banded together into the China Trade League in order to protect their common interest. By cutting off the government from the wealth of trade, the League was able to negotiate for their independance, establishing themselves in the largest trading cities. \n\nWhile lacking the manpower and resources of larger nations, the League cities' control over the flow of wealth to and from the East gives it considerable influence around the globe."
 VEN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:1 "Emerging "
 CAN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Canada entered the Great War as a mere colony and left it as a nation. Born in the mud of Passchendaele, Canada now takes its first few uncertain steps onto the world stage. \n\nHobbled by the Great Depression and with internal divisions between Anglophones and Francophones, the future of this new nation looks anything but secure."
 AST_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Australians earned their place in the history books of the Great War in blood. The sacrifices made in the Gallipolli campaign have not been forgotten - and neither were those who ordered it. \n\nAustralia now stands at a crossroads: should she stay with her colonial master, about to be drawn into yet another conflict in distant Europe, or should the focus be on the threats that are appearing closer to home?"
 SAF_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "When the Great War began, many in South Africa refused to take up arms for their British masters. The South African military spent most of the Great War chasing around German forces in their African colonies, with limited success. \n\nNow a new war looms on the horizon. Then as now, there are some in South Africa that think the country shouldn't be fighting against the Germans at all. Some even believe that the time has come for the descendents of the Boers to make their bid for the liberty that was denied to their forefathers."
 NZL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The tiny nation in the South Pacific fought bravely in the Great War, suffering high casualties in the bloody battles at Gallipoli and on the western front. Nearly half the men of fighting age had served in the fighting overseas, and many had not returned.\n\nSome twenty years after end of the Great War, the people of New Zealand look anxiously at the world stage, for this time, the threat of war seems to draw ever closer to their own home..."
 MAR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Having delivered the final blow to the declining Mughal Empire, Marathas took its place as the dominant power in the Indian subcontinent, and with their formidable navy and extensive army, they were able to keep foreign nations from their lands.\n\nHowever, there are some within the nation, unsatisfied even by Marathas' current power, who wish to establish 'Akhand Bharat' - India Undivided - a nation spanning the entirety of the subcontinent. Could such a dream be achieved, or will Marathas fall trying to achieve the impossible?"
 BLITZKRIEG_NAME:0 "Blitzkrieg"
 BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "In the last few years the world has seen some new wars break out in Europe and Asia. Spain is now governed by nationalists and Japan has fought both the Soviet Union and China for territory, the latter being a more successful battle for Japan. The new non-aggression pact between the Soviet Union and Germany may be bad news for the rest of Europe."
 ENG_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Although the United Kingdom emerged victorious from the Great War, the foundation of its great empire was shaken to its core. A generation of the country's finest were lost in the trenches of Flanders and Northern France, while unrest spread throughout the Commonwealth and massive debts accrued.\n\nWith the trauma of the last war still in fresh memory, the country now faces the prospect of another. It is becoming increasingly clear that there will be no Peace for Our Time."
 FRA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The Great War still fresh in its memory, France faces a new conflict after Germany showed they have no intention to keep the peace. Strengthening border defenses and choosing Allies wisely may very well be the way for France to avoid a disastrous war.\n\n France was victorious once before, this time shall be no different!"
 GER_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "After the remilitarization of the Rhineland, the French and the British grew increasingly suspicious of Germany's intentions. The Munich Agreement gave Germany permission to annex the Sudetenland for the sake of its German people. The Molotov-Ribbentrop pact guarantees non-aggression between Germany and the Soviet Union, but also specifies the partitioning of Poland between the two nations. \n\nGermany has waited too long for this moment. The time to act is now!"
 JAP_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "War is raging in the Southeast. Even though Japan suffered some losses early in '39, a big portion of Chinese territory is under Japanese control. Tension is rising in Europe, and while the Soviet Union is focusing their attention on those matters, they shouldn't interfere in the war in Asia. \n\nWhen China's resources are in Japanese hands, the Soviets will be easy to deal with."
 ITA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Mussolini, the dictator of Italy, achieved some fame as a peace keeper for his part in the Munich agreement a year ago. However, German territorial expansion has made Italy see there is more land to claim if an understanding with the Germans could be reached. \n\nAlbania has been conquered merely as a taste of Italy's military capabilities, and the rest of the world would do well to worry."
 SOV_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Supporting Manuel Azaña and the 'Second Spanish Republic' during the Spanish Civil War has clearly shown where the Soviet Union stands in relation to Italy and Germany. Victorious over the Japanese army in several recent border conflicts, the Soviet Union currently seems a power too major for any single country to oppose. \n\nThe promise made by Germany to partition the Baltic States and Poland is welcome at this time."
 USA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The rising tension in Europe is worrying. Although not yet a real concern for the United States, the aggression shown by Germany could soon be heard all over the world. While things are quite peaceful in the west, military preparations may not be a bad idea, all things considered. \n\nShould the United States get drawn into another war, they will be the ones to end it."
 OTHER_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Great War, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
 POL_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "After centuries in which the Polish nation has been divided between three empires, Poland now stands independent once again. But its position is not an easy one. \n\nIn the east, the Soviet Union has not forgotten the humiliating defeat in the Polish-Soviet war. \n\nIn the west, German Führer Adolf Hitler makes no secret of his desire for more "living space" - and that the former German areas now under Polish control will be the first step to achieve it."
 CAN_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Canada entered the Great War as a mere colony and left it as a nation. Born in the mud of Passchendaele, Canada now takes its first few uncertain steps onto the world stage. \n\nHobbled by the Great Depression and with internal divisions between Anglophones and Francophones, the future of this new nation looks anything but secure."

 RAJ_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The crown jewel of the British Empire, the Raj of India is a strange combination of imperial power and imperial powerlessness. A tiny elite of British civil servants rule over a vast subcontinent filled with hundreds of millions of subjects. From their ranks recruits the Indian Army, which fought bravely in the Great War.\n\nIndian leaders hoped that the sacrifices made in the last war would help India gain her independence from Britain, but so far, that hope has been disappointed. With a new war looming, many believe that the time has come to take that freedom - by whatever means necessary."
 CZE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "During the Great War, Czech troops fought alongside the Entente forces all over Europe in an effort to secure recognition for their nation. Their efforts were successful and Czechoslovakia rose from the ashes of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. \n\nSince their explosive entry into statehood Czechoslovakia formed the 'Little Entente' alliance with Yugoslavia and Romania with the aim of suppressing Hungary's efforts to restore the Austro-Hungarian Empire, although as resurgent German power grows the political landscape of Europe is rapidly changing."
 HUN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "One half of the late Austro-Hungarian Empire, Hungary was treated as a defeated enemy by the victorious Entente after the Great War. In the Treaty of Trianon, the country lost almost two thirds of its territory. Millions of ethnic Hungarians found themselves living outside its borders, and its economy was left in ruins. Harsh restrictions on rearmament were supposed to ensure that Hungary could never again threaten the peace in Europe. \n\nBut with the political climate in Europe shifting, the time may have come to finally right the wrongs of the past, and regain the former glory of the nation."
 ROM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Romania found herself on the winning side of the Great War, and as a result gained new territories and people - not all of whom were Romanians. To guard against the revanchionist desires of the countries that were forced to cede land, Romania has created a web of alliances all across the Balkans. In recent years, however, the country has concerned itself mostly with domestic matters, and the government of King Carol II has allowed these alliances to lapse. \n\nAs the political situation in Europe changes, Romania may well find herself standing alone - and vulnerable."

 YUG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Yugoslavia came into existence after the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes merged with the formerly independent Kingdom of Serbia in 1922. Initially Yugoslavia joined both the Little Entente and the Balkan Pact to secure their independence, but recently the assassination of King Alexander combined with growing internal pressure from nationalists and external pressure from Italy and Germany has caused drastic upheaval and reevaluation of their political and strategic position."

 PRC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "A mere two years ago, the Communist Party of China faced utter annihilation. To survive, it engaged on the epic journey that would become known as the Long March. With only a fraction of the army surviving the rigors of the march and little industry, the prospects of victory in the Chinese Civil War are slim indeed.\n\nBut in time, the population may be swayed to the Communist cause, new armies be raised, new base areas established, and, when the time is right, the revolutionary struggle will be renewed again, until final victory is achieved."
 CHI_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "After two years of war against the Japanese, the armies of Chiang Kai-Shek have bled themselves white trying to stop the assault. The enemy has overrun the richest areas of the country. Little support has been forthcoming from the western democracies, and the Communist seem unwilling to engage the enemy in open battle.\n\nWith the war threatening to spread even further, it appears that the worst is still to come. But as the Japanese attack is slowed by the vastness of the country, they may well turn their gaze in other directions, and new alliances may yet turn the tide..."
 PRC_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Faced with an all-out Japanese attack, the Nationalists and Communists have struck an uneasy truce. Both sides are well aware that this United Front can not last. The Communist base area in Yan'an now forms the front line in the war against the Japanese.\n\nThe Communists must husband their resources carefully if they want to survive. Any casualties suffered in the fight against Japan will be felt twice over when the time comes to fight the war against the Nationalists, and this may well be what the government of Chiang Kai-Shek is counting on..."
 MAN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Evicted from the Dragon Throne at the age of six, Puyi, the last Chinese Emperor, has been biding his time. While his former realm tore itself apart in the Chinese Civil War, Puyi found new allies in Japan.\n\nFor Puyi, the establishment of the Empire of Manchukuo in 1932 was but the first step in the quest to reclaim his ancestral birthright. For the moment, he is dependent on the Japanese Army to keep his rule, but in time, an opportunity might arise to cast off the shackles of servitude and become what he was born to be..."

 WARLORDS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The weakness of the Central Government may yet provide the opportunity for a sufficiently ambitious man to rise to power. At the periphery of the country, local leaders have carved out their own little fiefdoms, caring little for the orders of the Central Government. \n\nWar is on the horizon, and each of these Warlords faces a difficult choice: Collaboration with the Central Government or an alliance with the Communists? Either option promises a chance for a seat at the table, but there is a third possibility - to take China all for themselves."
 WARLORDS_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The war with Japan has forced the Chinese Warlords to pick a side. But there can be no doubt that this alliance is living on borrowed time. The day will come when it has outlived its usefullness, and on that day the game is once again open for every man ambitious and ruthless enough to make a play for the title of Ruler of China."
