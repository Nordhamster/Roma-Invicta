 MAN_low_legitimacy_5_desc:0 "Emperor Puyi is the legitimate descendent of the Qing emperors who ruled China for three hundred years. The Xinhai Revolution which deposed him in 1911 was very popular, as the late Qing government was powerless against both the foreigners stealing Chinese land and the regional governors establishing themselves as warlords. Emperor Puyi's installation by Japan as Emperor of Manchukuo is not yet accepted by the Manchurian populace, let alone the rest of China.\n\nWe will have to establish the Emperor's independence from Japan to rally the nation under him."

 MAN_kwantung_veto:0 "Kwantung Veto"
 MAN_kwantung_veto_desc:0 "After the 1905 Japanese seizure of Dalian from Russia, the Kwantung (Kantō in Japanese) garrison placed there became politicized, with expansionist generals taking the initiative in seizing more Chinese land for Japan. This culminated in the Mukden Incident in 1932, when the Empire of Manchukuo was carved out of the petty warlords of the north-east. The Kwantung Army continues to dominate the area and places the interests of their generals above the needs of Manchukuo.\n\nWe will only resolve this by getting the Japanese army to recognise us as equals, or by throwing them out by force."
